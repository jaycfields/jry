# jry

> another conjrib, pronounced 'dry'

----------

## Installing


The easiest way to use jry in your own projects is via
[Leiningen](http://github.com/technomancy/leiningen). Add the
following dependency to your project.clj file:

    [jry "1.0.11"]

To build jry from source, run the following commands:

    lein deps
    lein jar

## Examples

composing functions
    
    ; % as a shorthand for partial
    ((% identity 1)) => 1
    
basic functions

    ; exclusive or
    (xor true false) => true
    (xor true true) => false
    (xor false false) => false
    
    ; one? & two?
    (one? 1) => true
    (one? 3) => false
    (two? 2) => true
    (two? 8) => false

interop related functions

    ; truthy converts truthy values to true and falsey values to false
    ; good for functions that need to return true or false explicitly
    (truthy? "BRN") => true
    (truthy? true)  => true
    (truthy? nil)   => false

    ; falsey is the complement of truthy
    (falsey? "BRN") => false
    (falsey? true)  => false
    (falsey? nil)   => true

    ; obj->map allows you to convert from a Java object to a map
    ; without using reflection
    (obj->map (java.util.Date. 2012 0 31)
              :month .getMonth
              :year .getYear
              :day .getDate) => {:month 0 :year 2012 :day 31}
              
    ; parse-double & parse-long are available, and helpful when used with high-order fns
    (parse-double "2.1") => 2.1
    (parse-long "2") => 2

collections
   
    ; every is like every?, but it returns the entire list if
    ; everything is truthy; else, nil
    (every identity [1 2 3]) => [1 2 3]
    (every identity [1 false]) => nil

maps

    ; submap? returns true if a map is (recursively) a submap
    (submap? {:a 1 :b {:c 2}} {:a 1 :b {:c 2 :d 3} :e 4}) => true
    (submap? {:a 1 :b {:c 2}} {:a "9" :b {:c 2 :d 3} :e 4}) => false
    (submap? {:a 1 :b {:c 2}} {:a 1 :b {:c "9" :d 3} :e 4}) => false

    ; flatten-keys denormalizes keys.
    (flatten-keys {:a {:b 1 :e 3} :c {:d 2}}) => {[:a :b] 1 [:a :e] 3 [:c :d] 2}
    (flatten-keys {:a {:z nil :b 1 :e {:f 4 :g 5}}}) => {[:a :z] nil [:a :b] 1 [:a :e :f] 4 [:a :e :g] 5} 

    ; update-values applies a function (and any additional args) to
    ; each value in a map. 
    (update-values {:b {:c :d :e :f} :h {:c :d :e :f}} dissoc :c) => {:b {:e :f} :h {:e :f}}

    ; update-keys applies a function (and any additional args) to
    ; each key in a map.
    (update-keys {1 :a 2 :b} + 1) => {2 :a 3 :b}

    ; nth-values returns all values at or below a key depth
    (nth-vals 2 {1 {2 3} 4 {5 6}}) => [3 6]
    (nth-vals 2 {:a :a 1 {2 3} 4 {5 {6 7}}}) => [3 {6 7} :a]

    ; key-by keys a new map from an xrel by applying a fn to each
    ; element of an xrel
    (key-by :a [{:a 1 :b 1} {:a 2 :b 2} {:a 3 :b 3}]) => {1 {:a 1 :b 1} 2 {:a 2 :b 2} 3 {:a 3 :b 3}}

    ; xrelify converts a map into an xrel, mapping each k/v pair to a
    ; k key and a v key
    (xrelify {1 2 3 4} :x :y) => [{:x 1 :y 2} {:x 3 :y 4}]

    ; replace-values replaces the values of keys that exist in a map
    ; (and ignores any replacement values that have keys that do not
    ; exist in the original map)
    (replace-values {:a 1 :b 2} {:b 3 :c 4}) => {:a 1 :b 3}
